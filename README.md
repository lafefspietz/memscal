# [memscal](https://github.com/lafefspietz/memscal)

Open-source MEMS-based calibration system for quantum microwave metrology

## To do:

 - add dimensioned drawings to brackets in this document
 - add dimensioned drawing of Arduino UNO with all the holes
 - add all the Altium files and screen shots including schematics, and bills of materials
 - add all the gerber files with information about orders from pcbway
 - add links to all the data sheets
 - build a front panel for the 6 port switches using frontpanel express
 - write and test the code for the six port switch, get more information on that from Logan and Jordan
 - figure out how to add the dc connectors myself without getting those sent out
 - test every single pin
 - rewrite code for 8 port switch and test it
 - build an 8 port front panel
